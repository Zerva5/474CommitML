# Script Description

This script is used to convert the code changes in a Git commit to a set of one-hot vectors that represent the unique paths between each terminal of the abstract syntax trees of the pre-commit and post-commit snapshots of each method that has been changed in the commit. The output of the script can be used as input to machine learning models that learn from the code changes.

# How the Script Prepares Each Commit

The script takes in two arguments: the SHA of the commit to analyze and the path to the Git repository. After checking that the correct number of arguments has been provided, the script fetches the specified Git repository and the specified commit.

Next, the script identifies all the Python files that have been changed in the commit and extracts the pre-commit and post-commit snapshots of each method that has been changed in these files. The script builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) for each snapshot and computes the set of all unique paths (or contexts) between each terminal of each tree. The script then encodes the set of contexts as a set of vectors using one-hot encoding.

Finally, the script pads the one-hot encoded vectors with zeroes to ensure that all vectors have the same length. The length of each vector is set to 32 in the script, but this value can be changed by modifying the `SET_PATH_LENGTH` constant at the end of the script.


# Next Steps

The output of the script, which consists of a bag of one-hot encoded contexts, can be used as input to a path-attention model. In the path-attention model, the bag of path-contexts is fed into the network, and each path-context is represented as a context vector. The context vectors are concatenated and passed through a fully connected layer, which learns to combine the components of each context vector. The output of the fully connected layer is a set of combined context vectors, which are then weighted and combined into a single code vector using an attention mechanism. The resulting code vector represents the whole code snippet, and it can be used to predict the tags associated with the code.

To use the output of the script in a path-attention model, the bag of one-hot encoded contexts should be first condensed into a single vector. This can be done by looking up the embedding associated with each one-hot encoded context and mapping it to its corresponding embedding in the value_vocab and path_vocab matrices. The resulting embedding vectors can then be concatenated to form a context vector, which can be passed through the fully connected layer to generate a set of combined context vectors.

To calculate the attention weights, a global attention vector is initialized randomly and learned simultaneously with the network. The attention weight of each combined context vector is computed as the normalized inner product between the combined context vector and the global attention vector. The attention weights are then used as factors to combine the combined context vectors into a single code vector.

The resulting code vector can be used to predict the tags associated with the code. The tags are represented as embeddings in the tags_vocab matrix, and the predicted distribution of the model is computed as the (softmax-normalized) dot product between the code vector and each of the tag embeddings. The resulting probabilities represent the likelihood of each tag being associated with the code.

# Define a test input
test_input = np.zeros((1, one_hot_paths.shape[1], path_vocab.shape[0]+value_vocab.shape[0]))

This code assumes that the output of the script has been saved to a file called 'one_hot_paths.npy', and that the vocabularies have been saved to files called 'path_vocab.npy', 'value_vocab.npy', and 'tags_vocab.npy'. The code defines a path-attention model using the Keras API, with an input layer that takes as input the one-hot encoded paths, and embedding layers that map the paths to their corresponding embeddings in the path_vocab and value_vocab matrices. The context vectors are formed by concatenating the path and value embeddings, and the fully connected layer learns to combine the components of each context vector. The attention mechanism computes attention weights for each context vector, and combines them into a single code vector. Finally, the code vector is used to predict the tags associated with the code using a softmax output layer.

To make a prediction, the code defines a test input that contains the one-hot encoded paths. The input is passed to the model, and the predicted tags are obtained by taking the argmax of the output of the softmax layer.
